## Overview

* Created a employee directory with React. 
* Found React ideally suited as wanted to divide application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
* Added filters to allow data sorting by name and data of birth. (see file named `Table.jsx`)
* Data is provided in the data.json file.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the application.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
